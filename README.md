## What problem does it solve?

The GraphQL Retain transformer is a custom directive that you can install and use in your
AWS Amplify API schema. It will then set the `DeletionPolicy` of the created DynamoDB
tables from the default `Delete` to `Retain`.

What this does is it will make sure that those resources and its contents are not getting
removed during a stack deletion. The deletion process will run through successfully, but
you can still find the old DynamoDB table in your AWS admin console.

**Attention:** If you create a new DynamoDB table with the exact same name, it will then
overwrite the retained table and its data! So creating backups are still a good thing to
do from time to time üòâ

## Installation

`npm install --save graphql-retain-transformer`

## How to use

### Setup custom transformer

Edit `amplify/backend/api/<YOUR_API>/transform.conf.json` and append `"graphql-retain-transformer"` to the `transformers` field.

```json
"transformers": [
    "graphql-retain-transformer"
]
```

### Use @retain directive

Append `@retain` to target types.

```graphql
type Todo @model @retain {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
}
```

## Contribute ü¶∏

Contributions are more than welcome! I love how AWS Amplify helps us developers building great apps in a short time. That's why I'd like to give back with contributions like this. If you feel the same and would like to join me in this project it would be awesome to get in touch! üòä

Please feel free to create, comment and of course solve some of the issues. To get started you can also go for the easier issues marked with the `good first issue` label if you like.

### Development

- It is important to always make sure the version of the installed `graphql` dependency matches the `graphql` version the `graphql-transformer-core` depends on.
